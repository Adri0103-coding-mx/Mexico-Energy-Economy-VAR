# 🇲🇽 Mexico’s Energy–Economy: VAR–IRF & FEVD

This repository contains the code, data processing routines, and analytical results developed for the study **“Mexico’s energy–economy linkages: a VAR-based exploration with Impulse Response Functions (IRF) and Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD)”**.

The project forms part of a broader research effort on the dynamic interactions between Mexico’s energy sector and its macroeconomic variables, particularly focusing on the fiscal and structural implications of the energy transition.

## 📘 Project Overview

This study applies a **Vector Autoregression (VAR)** framework to analyze the bidirectional linkages between energy and economic variables in Mexico.

The pipeline includes:
- Stationarity testing (ADF, KPSS)
- Differencing and standardization
- Optimal lag selection (AIC, BIC, HQC)
- Model fitting and diagnostics (Ljung–Box, ACF/PACF)
- Impulse Response Function (IRF) analysis
- Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD)
- Visualization and interpretation of dynamic responses

## ⚙️ Methodological Framework

Figure (in the paper) summarizes the empirical workflow:
1. **Preprocessing:** Stationarity and multicollinearity tests.
2. **Modeling:** Estimation of the VAR(p) system.
3. **Evaluation:** Residual diagnostics and forecast performance.
4. **Dynamic analysis:** IRF and FEVD interpretation.

Extensions to **VECM**, **SVAR**, or **Bayesian VAR** are considered as potential future developments.

## 📊 Main Variables
The analysis includes representative indicators such as:
- GDP at current prices  
- Renewable installed capacity (MW)  
- Oil rents (% of GDP)  
- Crude oil production (bbl/day)  
- Energy consumption per capita  
- Energy imports/exports  

All data were obtained from official sources (INEGI, SENER, World Bank, BP Statistical Review).

## 🧠 Reproducibility
All scripts are modular and reproducible.
