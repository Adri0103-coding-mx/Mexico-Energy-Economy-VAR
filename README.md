# 🇲🇽 Mexico’s Energy–Economy: VAR–IRF & FEVD

This repository contains the code, data processing routines, and analytical results developed for the study **“Mexico’s energy–economy linkages: a VAR-based exploration with Impulse Response Functions (IRF) and Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD)”**.

The project forms part of a broader research effort on the dynamic interactions between Mexico’s energy sector and its macroeconomic variables, particularly focusing on the fiscal and structural implications of the energy transition.

## 📘 Project Overview

This study applies a **Vector Autoregression (VAR)** framework to analyze the bidirectional linkages between energy and economic variables in Mexico.

The pipeline includes:
- Stationarity testing (ADF, KPSS)
- Differencing and standardization
- Optimal lag selection (AIC, BIC, HQC)
- Model fitting and diagnostics (Ljung–Box, ACF/PACF)
- Impulse Response Function (IRF) analysis
- Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD)
- Visualization and interpretation of dynamic responses
